# SentimentalAnalysisFlipkart
This Streamlit application performs web scraping on Flipkart reviews for a specific product and conducts sentiment analysis on the extracted reviews. The process involves utilizing Selenium for dynamic web page interaction, BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML content, and NLTK's VADER sentiment analysis tool. The application then generates visualizations of sentiment distribution using Matplotlib.
